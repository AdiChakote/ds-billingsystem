# Smart Inventory and Billing System

This is a simple Python-based console application that simulates a basic
inventory and billing system for a retail store.

The system supports:
- Customer purchase flow
- Automatic stock updates
- Discount-based billing
- Basic stock management for shopkeepers

This project was built to practice Python fundamentals such as
dictionaries, functions, conditional logic, and user input handling.
